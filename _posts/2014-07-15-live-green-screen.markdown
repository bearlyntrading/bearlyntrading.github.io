description: A project presented at Hansen House - Center for Design, Media and Technology in Jerusalem.<br/><br/>In this project I take the use of depth photography one step forward by combining a realtime stream of video with footage captured in the past from a similar point of view.<br/>Hansen House served as a leprosy asylum for more then a century, so I shot a scene of doctor and patient, in a restorated patient's room.<br/>This innovative photographical exploration blurs the distinction between the past and the present and leaves the visitor with a unique feeling of finding himslef transported into a past scene taking place in the same location.
