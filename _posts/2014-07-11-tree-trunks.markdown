description: A piece I presented in an exhibition in the Jerusalem Bird Observatory.<br/><br/>The exhibition subject was our surrounding nature.<br/>I chose to focus on tree trunks.<br/>I've developed a unique method to create tree trunks copies of clay, using modeling clay and slip.<br/>I've used different kinds of oxides to create the natural coloring.
details: Earthenware<br/><br/>Approximately 20 X 27 cm each
