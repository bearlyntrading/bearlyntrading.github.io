        <p>Hello, my name is Jasmin Rubinovitz.<br/><br/>
            I'm interested in computer human interactions and the relation between, arts, crafts and design with developed technology. <br />
            I'm currently a Research Assistant and a Graduate Student in the Viral Communications group at MIT Media Lab. Before I was a software engineer intern at Google, and a B.fa student at the ceramic design department of Bezalel Academy For Art and Design. <br />
            I hold a B.sc of Computer Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br />
