Inspired by Google's Cardboard and the ancient [Pepper's Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost) magic trick I've designed an build a DIY Augmented Reality device, that anyone can build for under 5$, using a piece of cardboard, a piece of clear acrylic and a smarthphone.

My certification journey started december 2016. Having completed some modules, and attending a lot of self-taught experienceâ€”I felt my ability and confident increased. There are a lot of free or some with a little money Online course. The online courses makes me more easily to learn at the university and in the exams.
