My certification journey started december 2016. Having completed some modules, and attending a lot of self-taught experienceâ€”I felt my ability and confident increased. There are a lot of free or some with a little money Online course. The online courses makes me more easily to learn at the university and in the exams.

This is the site for all of my certification: https://certification.gitbook.io/cevi/
