The Power Query M formula language is optimized for building highly flexible data mashup queries. It's a functional, case sensitive language similar to F#.  More about power Query: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/query-bi/m/power-query-m-reference">Power Query M Reference</a>

I learn Power Query during my work as working student from September 2016 at HTW Berlin-University of Applied Sciences.
My project is to automate my University reporting for Federal Statistical Office of Germany.
