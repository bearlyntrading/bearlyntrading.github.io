**PA:= People Analytics**

Deutsche Bahn AG started more Data Science Project from this year, 2018. I work for HR Analytics under supervision of HR Manager of Deutsche Bahn AG. There are more than one life cycle that we know, but we focusing on data mining methode the CRISP-DM model (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). 

The CRISP model steps are:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation and
6. Deployment

For thema Business Understanding I got some of Seminar, additional lectures , and Business Process Systeme from Deusche Bahn AG. 
Not only the concept but also the tools and a lot of workshop. Below are summarise from A-Z about HR analytics, methode, and tools.
Note: This summary isn't the real situation in Deutsche Bahn AG (data protection information rule)

#1. BIG DATA

The principle of Big Data works that the more you have data about anything or any situation, the more accurately you get new insights and make predictions about what will happen in the future. Also revealed new ways to understand trends in business and in our daily lives. By comparing more and more data and creating relationships that were previously hidden enable us to learn and make more smarter decisions on targeting business values such as sales, production, or financial situations. In this term, people analytics makes the company situation better that have positive feedback for the company self.

#2. WORKFORCE ANALYTICS
Data Science to optimize human resource management (HRM).

You can use Gobo to control what’s edited out of your feed, or configure it to include news and points of view from outside your usual orbit. Gobo aims to be completely transparent, showing you why each post was included in your feed and inviting you to explore what was filtered out by your current filter settings.  Learn more and try it out on <a href="https://gobo.social">gobo.social</a>.

To use Gobo, you link your Twitter and Facebook accounts to Gobo and choose a set of news publications that most closely resembles the news you follow online. Gobo retrieves recent posts from these social networks and lets you decide which ones you want to see. Want more posts from women? Adjust aslider to set the gender balance of your feed… or just click on the “mute all men” button and listen to the folks who often get shouted down in online dialogs. Want to broaden the perspectives in your feed? Move the politics slider from “my perspective” to “lots of perspectives” and Gobo introduces news stories from sources you might not otherwise find.

Gobo retrieves posts from people you follow on Twitter and Facebook and analyzes them using simple machine learning-based filters. You can set those filters – seriousness, rudeness, virality, gender and brands – to eliminate some posts from your feed. The “politics” slider works differently, “filtering in”, instead of “filtering out” – if you set the slider towards “lots of perspectives”, our “news echo” algorithm will start adding in posts from media outlets that you likely don’t read every day.

Gobo is a team effort I worked on together with Rahul Bhargava, Alexis Hope, Ethan Zuckerman and other talented people at the MIT Center for Civic Media with support from The Knight Foundation.
