I learn R programming from Okt. 2013. My Prof was Prof. Dr Beate Bergter.

She teached me how to using R Programming with R Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in all statistics courses (Descriptive statistics, Probability, and Inferential statistics) and analytics (Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics)
