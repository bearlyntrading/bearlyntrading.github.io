**Problems addressed:**
* Critical path analysis or project planning: identifying those processes in a complex project which affect the overall duration of the project
* Floorplanning: designing the layout of equipment in a factory or components on a computer chip to reduce manufacturing time (therefore reducing cost)
* Network optimization: for instance, setup of telecommunications or power system networks to maintain quality of service during outages
* Allocation problems
* Facility location
* Assignment Problems:
    * Assignment problem
    * Generalized assignment problem
    * Quadratic assignment problem
    * Weapon target assignment problem
* Bayesian search theory: looking for a target
* Optimal search
* Routing, such as determining the routes of buses so that as few buses are needed as possible
* Supply chain management: managing the flow of raw materials and products based on uncertain demand for the finished products
* Project production activities: managing the flow of work activities in a capital project in response to system variability through operations research tools for variability reduction and buffer allocation using a combination of allocation of capacity, inventory and time[27][28]
* Efficient messaging and customer response tactics
* Automation: automating or integrating robotic systems in human-driven operations processes
* Globalization: globalizing operations processes in order to take advantage of cheaper materials, labor, land or other productivity inputs
* Transportation: managing freight transportation and delivery systems (Examples: LTL shipping, intermodal freight transport, travelling salesman problem)
* Scheduling:
      * Personnel staffing
      * Manufacturing steps
      * Project tasks
      * Network data traffic: these are known as queueing models or queueing systems.
      * Sports events and their television coverage
* Blending of raw materials in oil refineries
* Determining optimal prices, in many retail and B2B settings, within the disciplines of pricing science
* Cutting stock problem: Cutting small items out of bigger ones.
