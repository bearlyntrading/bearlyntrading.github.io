-An R Notebook is an R Markdown document with chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.

-Notebook output are available as HTML, PDF, Word, or Latex. 

-This Notebook as HTML is preferably open with Google Chrome.

-R-Code can be extracted as Rmd file under the button "Code" in the notebook.

**What is OpenRefine?**

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data.

* Formerly known as "Google Refine"
* Free & open-source
* Tool for cleaning large datasets
* Can create links between metadata sets
* Desktop application - run locally (without worry about data privacy)
