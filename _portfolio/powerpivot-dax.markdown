# What is Power Pivot and DAX?
<Br>
Power Pivot is an Excel add-in you can use to perform powerful data analysis and create sophisticated data models. With Power Pivot, you can mash up large volumes of data from various sources, perform information analysis rapidly, and share insights easily. More about Power Pivot:<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/power-pivot-powerful-data-analysis-and-data-modeling-in-excel-a9c2c6e2-cc49-4976-a7d7-40896795d045"> Power Pivot </a>

Power Pivot has DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) as data modelling tools (Functional Programming). 
We can use DAX to define custom calculations for Calculated Columns and for Measures (also known as calculated fields). DAX includes some of the functions used in Excel formulas, and additional functions designed to work with relational data and perform dynamic aggregation.

I learn Power Pivot and DAX formula during my work as working student at my university (HTW Berlin-University of Applied Sciences), from start: September 2016.
The Power Pivot and DAX supported my project to automating reporting for <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Homepage.html"> Federal Statistical Office of Germany (destatis) </a>.
