# What is KPI (Key Performance Indicators)?
<Br>
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are the critical (key) indicators or measurement to check the success of a department or organization.
Each business or department have different KPIs because they all have different tasks and goals.
<Br>
But There are five main types of KPIs:
* Business KPIs
* Financial KPIs
* Sales KPIs
* Marketing KPIs
* Project Management KPIs


Based on my work experiences, there are a plenty data visualization software in the markets (even a MS-Excel too). 

I works with two of them Tableau and Power BI. But I adapt to new concepts and software quickly.
