Deutsche Bahn AG is a German railway company. Headquartered in Berlin, it is a private joint-stock company, with the Federal Republic of Germany being its single shareholder. People call Deutsche Bahn AG with DB.

From this year (2018) DB started more Data Science Project. I work for HR Analytics in DB Headquarter in Berlin under supervision of HR Manager of Deutsche Bahn AG. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data (wikipedia.com). 

When working with data science project, it is always important to follow a well-defined data science workflow. There are more than one life cycle that we know, but we focusing on data mining method the **CRISP-DM model** (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). 

The CRISP model steps are:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation and
6. Deployment

For theme Business Understanding I got some Seminar, additional lectures , and Business Process System from Deusche Bahn AG.
Not only the concept but also the tools and a lot of workshops. Below are summarised from A-Z about HR analytics, method, and tools.

**Note: This summary isn't the real situation in Deutsche Bahn AG (data protection information rule)**

**#1. BIG DATA**

The principle of Big Data works that the more you have data about anything or any situation, the more accurately you get new insights and make predictions about what will happen in the future. Also revealed new ways to understand trends in business and in our daily lives. By comparing more and more data and creating relationships that were previously hidden enable us to learn and make more smarter decisions on targeting business values such as sales, production, or financial situations. In this term, people analytics makes the company situation better that have positive feedback for the company self.
