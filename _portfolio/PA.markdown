Deutsche Bahn AG is a German railway company. Headquartered in Berlin, it is a private joint-stock company, with the Federal Republic of Germany being its single shareholder. People call Deutsche Bahn AG with DB.

From this year (2018) DB started more Data Science Project. I work for HR Analytics in DB Headquarter in Berlin under supervision of HR Manager of Deutsche Bahn AG. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data (wikipedia.com). 

When working with data science project, it is always important to follow a well-defined data science workflow. There are more than one life cycle that we know, but we focusing on data mining method the **CRISP-DM model** (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). 

The CRISP model steps are:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation and
6. Deployment

For theme Business Understanding I got some Seminar, additional lectures , and Business Process System from Deusche Bahn AG.
Not only the concept but also the tools and a lot of workshops.


Below are summarised from A-Z about HR analytics, method, and tools.
Note: This summary isn't the real situation in Deutsche Bahn AG (data protection information rule)

**#1. BIG DATA**

The principle of Big Data works that the more you have data about anything or any situation, the more accurately you get new insights and make predictions about what will happen in the future. Also revealed new ways to understand trends in business and in our daily lives. By comparing more and more data and creating relationships that were previously hidden enable us to learn and make more smarter decisions on targeting business values such as sales, production, or financial situations. In this term, people analytics makes the company situation better that have positive feedback for the company self.

**#3. HR PREDICTOR**

<Br>
-Turnover modeling. It may be able to predict future turnover in your business in specific functions, business units, geographies and countries by looking at factors such as commute time, time since last role change, and performance over time. This means you can scale your hiring efforts accordingly, reducing empty desk time and panic hiring, which can lead to lower cost, higher quality hiring.
<Br>
-Recruitment advertising measurement. Response modeling for advertising jobs. You can use your experience from previous campaigns to avoid contacting candidates or using channels that donâ€™t yield a response and focus on those channels that do work.
<Br>
-Targeted retention. Find out which employees or groups of employees are at high risk of churn in the future and focus retention activities on those who are more in need and reduce it in other areas where it is not needed as much.
<Br>
-Risk Management: develop a profile of candidates with a higher risk of leaving prematurely or performing below standard.
<Br>
-Talent Forecasting. Being able to predict which new hires, based on their profile, are likely to be high fliers and then moving them in to your high potential programs.
