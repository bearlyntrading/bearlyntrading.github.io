While 'Visualization' focuses on visual representations of data, 'Sonification' focuses on the auditory equivalent.
<br/>
Most sonifications used today (such as a car's reverse proximity indication or a heart monitor) are based on synthetic audio, typically alternating between pure tones.
<br/>
This project focuses on suggesting an alternative, by using natural audio in order to communicate the necessary information.
<br/>
<br/>
The algorithm developed searches a large repository of natural sounds using an efficient approximate-nearest-neighbour technique to find the best match to the data in the encoded version of the audio repository. A demonstration of the method is provided by communicating an artist's popularity rate over time by finding a musical segment from his oeuvre that has a corresponding amplitude pattern.
